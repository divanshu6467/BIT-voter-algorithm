# Bit-level-Median-filter-algorithm
A new bit-level algorithm for general purpose median filtering based on (this IEEE paper)[citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.508.6978&rep=rep1&type=pdf].

Median filtering has proved an effective way to  remove impulse noise while preserving rapid 
signal changes. A classic general purpose Median filter is based on a ‘Bubble Sort’ approach. But hardware implementation of this algorithm is vey ineffieient

the  presents  a  novel  bit-level  algorithm  which can be easily implemented on hardware.
The  basis  of  the  algorithm  is  similar  to  that  of  Quicksort,  and  is  based  on  a  ‘Bit  
Voter’  (BV)  block.
